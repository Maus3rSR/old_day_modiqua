# Nostalgia for the old days

This is my first web project ever during an internship in 2012 at Modiqua company.

I've been asked to create a website for the company, with a blog, a contact form, a news section, a temoignage section, a documentation section and a sitemap.
The website was multilingual, with a French, English and a German version and with an administration panel to manage the content of the website.
I've done it using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.

You can admire very old school way to code a php website by a fresh web developper junior ðŸ˜Ž.
